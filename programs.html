						<p>Supervised by Licensed Teachers</p>
						<p>2-8 Week Instructional Summer Sports Program</p>
						<p>At Discovery Sports Academy, our goals are simple: motivate, improve skills, enhance competitive spirit, develop team players, and have fun. Our Program is designed to instruct campers in the basic techniques of a variety of sporting activities and to advance the experienced player in skills and knowledge of the game.</p>
						<p>Everyone is a "super star" at Discovery. Players are grouped by age and ability. Our instructors design instructional drills to enhance and stress basic fundamental techniques and practice these skills through exciting intra-camp tournaments and events. We draft every camper to become part of a team, which participates in a series of round robin tournaments in basketball, baseball, soccer, kickball, and football.</p>
						<p>Nobody’s Perfect: If the "Pros" can benefit from constant coaching, so can our campers. Discovery Summer Camp Coaches are selected from all of the athletic disciplines. They offer individualized instruction to encourage the athletic advancement and development of each camper.</p>
						<p>From the Ball Fields to Adventureland, Laser Tag, Sportsplex... and Much More.</p>
						<p>At Discovery Sports Academy, we do not limit our camper activities to sports alone. There are exciting trips and adventures to take to area amusement parks, Citi Field, Laser Tag, and other great places for kids to explore.</p>

						<h3>&#8226;SUMMER DAY CAMP QUESTIONS</h3><br/>
						<p>If you have any questions or concerns at any time during the session, please feel free to call us. Our goal is to keep your child smiling while learning to swim! We hope your child will enjoy coming to class each day. This is how we know we did a good job.</p>
					</div>
					<!-- right side -->
					<div  id="side3-2">
						<h3 >&#8226;SWIMMING (Included in both summer camp programs)</h3><br/>
						<p>Most of us can appreciate how intimidating the water can be, especially for very young campers. That’s why our Swim Program stresses safety, fun, and most importantly, instruction by certified staff. To further encourage safe, enjoyable swimming, we rely on the "buddy system" approach. This insures that no child is in the water without a friend and safety partner. This time-tested approach is utilized in our beautiful outdoor private facility (featuring both Olympic size and kiddie pools).</p>
						<br/>
						<h3>&#8226;SUMMER DAY CAMP PHILOSOPHY</h3><br/>
						<p>We believe every child is special and unique in the way they develop mentallyand physically. With all the demands and pressures on children today, we believe swim lessons should be a fun and meaningful experience. At the same time, westrongly believe the skills we are teaching children could make a difference throughout their personal lives, and we take this task seriously. Each child is challenged gently and patiently while encouraged to master the skills taught.</p>
						<br/>

						<h3>&#8226;OUR SUMMER DAY CAMP SWIM INSTRUCTORS</h3><br/>
						<p>Our instructors are lifeguards. Instructors are carefully picked and sensitive to the needs of children.</p>
						<br/>

						<h3>&#8226;OUR SUMMER DAY CAMP SWIMMING PROGRAM</h3><br/>
						<p>Campers receive swim instruction 3 days per week in 45 minute intervals, accompanied by time to practice their skills during the recreational swim. Our program is separated by age group. All swimmers are individually tested and evaluated. They are placed into small groups based on their individual needs. Lifeguards also offer 1:1 instruction.</p>
						<br/>
						<h3>&#8226;SUMMER DAY CAMP SWIMMING LESSON EVALUATION</h3><br/>
						<p>At the end of each session, swimmers are evaluated and a progress card is sent home. REMEMBER swimming is not a pass/fail program. Your child needs to develop these physical skills with practice and time. It is common for a child to be in the same level for an entire camp year. Do NOT compare your child with others. He/she is an individual and needs to seek personal goals versus group/peer goals.</p>
